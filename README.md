# How to Play the Meme Game 

## Setup 

If you're playing this on our site, you don't need this step but if you want to run the app from the code here, you'll need to obtain an api key from [wordnik](http://developer.wordnik.com) and [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/) and put the keys in a file called wordnik.key and flickr.key. 

About
----------
The internet is inundated with memes. But the creator of these memes often does not receive proper credit or compensation. On our innovative new website, The Meme Game, users will be able to post their memes to be bought and sold by others. Upon signing up, every user receives a certain amount of meme money and becomes a meme machine. At first memes have to be manually made through the meme machine’s channels of choice. As the meme machine develops fame, however, one can instead have random photos pulled to inspire memes for them, or even have a meme created without any of the user’s input at all. Ownership of a good meme will be coveted and the meme will be bought and sold often by the site’s other users. The price of a meme depends on how many times it has been sold. The more times a meme has changed hands, the more value the meme accrues.
